# pattern Lock system
Iâ€™m excited to share my latest project, a smartphone pattern lock system! This interactive web-based pattern lock allows users to create secure patterns by dragging across circles, just like on a smartphone. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what I implemented:

# âœ¨ Features:

Dynamic Pattern Tracking: The system records the sequence of circles selected by the user, updating the pattern in real-time.
Adjacency Logic: Only adjacent circles can be selected, ensuring a valid input sequence.
Error Handling: If the pattern is invalid, the interface highlights errors, resetting after a short delay.
Reset Functionality: Users can reset their pattern and try again with a single click.
This project gave me an opportunity to sharpen my JavaScript skills, especially in areas like event handling and DOM manipulation.
